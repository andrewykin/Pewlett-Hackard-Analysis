# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard wants to know more about the upcoming "silver tsunami", more specifically, how many employees are retiring per title & identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The firm may become understaffed and lack senior leadership. In this exercise we used pgAdmin 4 and SQL to build relevant tables to analyze Pewlett-Hackard's workforce.

into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
